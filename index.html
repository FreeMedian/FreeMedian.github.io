        <h3>Content removal</h3>

        <p>
        <p>On FreeMedian Apps you find links that lead to audio files. These files are stored somewhere
            else on the internet (frequently zippyshare.com) and are NOT a part of FreeMedian Apps. FreeMedian does NOT
            carry ANY responsibility for
            them, FreeMedian Apps ONLY COLLECTS links and INDEXES other sites contents. Our website is fully
            automatized.
            This means that we are crawling other mp3 websites and directories, indexing them and then linking to those
            mp3 files they offer. FreeMedian respects the DMCA laws.<br/><br/>If your copyrighted material has been
            indexed by FreeMedian and you want this material removed, you must provide a written communication with
            exact reference to the content you claim ownership to. This message must contain following:<br/><br/>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name and the exact URL of your copyrighted material.</b><br/>(i.e.
                http://www.our-webiste.com/page.html) or screen of mobile app
            </li>
            <li><b>Contact information so that we may contact you (street address, phone and email).</b></li>
            <li><b>Clear proof of evidence that you own the copyright to said content or evidence that you are a
                representative of the person/company owning the content.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <br/>For such a request , please mail us directly at : <b>freemedian@gmail.com</b><br/>We suggest that if you
        really want to permanently remove your copyrighted material from the internet, you should contact the
        administrator of the physical URL where your copyrighted material is hosted.<br/><br/>
        <center><b>Do not forget!</b></center>
        <br/>We will reply to and clear EVERY request. We will not reply to automatized bot messages though, or messages
        missing any information listed above. Please notice it may take up to 72 hours to process your request. Don't
        bother sending your request to our ISP, hosting company or anyone else - it will only take MORE time to process
        your request, as all messages are forwarded to the email address above.<br/>
